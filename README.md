# Facebook Clone

Facebook Clone is a full-stack replica of Facebook’s front-end functionality and layout. It simulates core features like user registration and login, posting content, and viewing posts in a feed. The project includes both a client side (UI / React or similar) and an api server to handle data operations, upload media, and user sessions.

The aim is to recreate the look and basic flow of Facebook—social feed, interaction (like/comment/share), user accounts—in order to learn full-stack design patterns, RESTful API creation, and UI/UX layout.
